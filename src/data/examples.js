/**
 * Here you can put examples queries for your application. You need to fill the examples array with
 * objects with the following keys:
 *
 * - title: The title of the example
 * - query: The query to execute
 *
 * For example, in MQL you could write:
 * { title: 'Get 100 quads', query: 'MATCH (?from)-[?edge :?type]->(?to) RETURN * LIMIT 100' }
 *
 * Or in SPARQL:
 * { title: 'Get 100 triples', query: 'SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100' }
